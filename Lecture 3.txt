Analogy - comparison between one domain and another
	Mapping of multi-place (relation between objects) predicates (Property)
	Prefer to map relations rather than properties
	Comparison of atom and solar system some properties mapped others are not (e.g. properties of specific planets)
	Orbit around the nucleus, orbit around the sun
	Don't think about one of the electrons having people
The back button is a stack but usually not thought of in this way. Doesn't map well with our mental model.
This can cause users to become lost

Mental models as problem spaces

When you are thinking through a problem you are searching a problem space
Problem solving can therefore be thought of as search. You have a list of possible states that you look through (search)
to solve the problem. Apply operators to the start state to achieve the goal state
You can map out a diagram of all possible states (for a small problem) this is known as a problem space
problem space - diagram/list of all possible states

RPN calculator study 
One group shown stack diagram and how it works
Other given a verbal explanation of how to translate algebra to RPN
The group given the diagram had a better problem space model of the states that the calculator was in
This allowed the group to solve creative problems quicker
Routine tasks had no differences

Mental models can be thought of as homomorphisms (Shares structure of the world it represents)
Distinction between arbitary representations and non-arbitary structure sharing representations very important
e.g. writing about a room and the number of people in it (Arbitary) compared to drawing a diagram of the room (Non-arbitary, shares the structure of the world)
representations can do the logic for you
Height comparison (diagram and writing)
